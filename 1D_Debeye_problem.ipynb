    "In this exercise, we are going to explore the Debeye model in one dimension. In particular, we will calculate the internal energy $U(\\tau)$ and the Heat Capacity $C_V(\\tau)=\\frac{dU}{d\\tau}$ as a function of temperature. We will also explore the range of applicability of the assumptions that the the sum over states can be treated as an integral and that low frequency modes involving many particles produce the observed heat capacity at low temperatures missing in the Einstein model.\n",

    "We assume that the $N$ atoms in our system are arranged in a line of length $L$, with spacing between atoms of $a$. Waves travel in the line of atoms at a speed $c_s$. The system is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir of temperature $\\tau$. As it is a 1D system, there is only one longitudinal polarization.\n",

    "The energy of this system is the phonon energy times the phonon occupation number summed over N total modes for the system $$U(\\tau) = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_n}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_n}{\\tau}\\right) -1}$$\n",

    "In Lecture, we calculated an approximate result for the (three dimensional) heat capacity valid for low temperatures. We did this by taking $\\omega_D = \\infty$, performing the definite integral and then differentiating the result with respect to $\\tau$. This is fine for the low temperature limit of the heat capacity, but will not yield valid results over the whole temperature range. To do this correctly, we need to differentiate the expression for $U(\\tau)$ before summing or integrating over modes.\n",

    "Although it will not be part of your homework submission, you should work through this problem to make sure that you can reproduce these results. Although we are specifically working with a 1D system in this problem, the calculation for the heat capacity for the 3D Debeye model proceeds similarly."

    "d) Now return to the expression you wrote for heat capacity $\\frac{C_V}{N}$ in terms of a sum over modes. Instead of treating the sum as an integral, evaluate the sum exactly. In turning the sum into an integral we assumed that there are many modes with phonon energy less than the thermal energy. This will break down in the limit of small N and low temperature and this exact sum will be more accurate.  For N=1000, plot the value of $\\frac{C_V}{N}$ from the sum as a function of temperature over the range $0.01 < \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_D} < 10$ in steps of $\\sim 0.01$. Plot your result on a log-log scale. Compare your result with the integral approximation by plotting overplotting the integral result for $\\frac{C_V}{N}$ on top of your result for the sum with $N=1000$. What does your plot tell you about the accuracy of the continuum appoximation for $N=1000$ particles over this temperature range? Repeat this plot for $N=10$ and comment on the differences."

Calculate the ratio of the heat capacity per particle for N particles $\\frac{C_V(N)}{N}$ over $\\frac{C_V(N)}{N}$ (for $N=1000$). In this case, we are choosing the result for $N=1000$  as a reference where the particle number is large enough to have no effect.

Why is heat capacity in the low temperature regime particularly sensitive to N? Explain your results in terms of our original motivation for the Debeye model over the Einstein solid model."
